The ambidextrous gloves are available in 9.5\" and 12\" (Nitrile-Xtra™) lengths, are available in various sizes and have a beaded cuff for easy donning. Your workers will enjoy excellent dexterity and tactile sensitivity, thanks to the textured fingertips. They are even cleared for use in chemotherapy.
